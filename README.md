### Hello & Welcome to my Github Profile

I'm a Software Engineer currently working at [Perlego](https://perlego.com), an Edtech startup based in London, UK.

I studied Geography at University, hence I've arrived at my current role via a non-conventional route. Whilst completing my MSc in GIS, I learnt Python, primarily for spatial analysis work, rather than software development. However, that was my entry route into this crazy world of web and I've loved it ever since.
